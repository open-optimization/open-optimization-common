# About Open Optimization

- Open education resources
- Commercial use is allowed - discuss why this choice is made.

Welcome to Open Optimization - an ecosystem for open-source materials for teaching optimization and operations research.  This ecosystem is being formed to host open-source lecture notes, lecture slides, examples, code, figures, and textbooks on material and courses related to optimization and operation research.

All material other than code will be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) that permits free reuse and alteration of the material provided the proper attribution is given.  All material posted will be not just open-source, but open-source code as well - including LaTeX, tikz, and other means of generating content.  This allows those interested in reusing material an easy way to change and adapt the material as needed.

All code (e.g., Julia, Python, AMPL, GAMS, MatLab, etc.) on this repository will be licensed freely under the MIT License.  This is in an effort to make code simple and easy to reuse.

Please see ![CONTRIBUTING-lincences](https://github.com/open-optimization/open-optimization-common/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-licenses.md) for more detailed explanation of lincence choices and how to contribute.

Your contributions to this endeavor are greatly valued and appreciated.  We hope you will help with this project and also use it as a resource for future courses, lectures, and presentations.

Content posted here may be adapted into freely available open-source textbooks published.  



# Memorandum of Understanding: Open Optimization
Open Optimization is a collaborative project, aimed at creating a quality open textbook/open resource for university courses in optimization, operations research, and related courses. This project will host open-source lecture notes, lecture slides, examples, code, figures, and textbooks.  All materials will be accompanied by source code (.tex, .tikz, etc) for easy generation and adaptation.  The project goals are to:
- Create freely available content to make easier teaching, designing courses, writing presentations, and finding reusable content.
- Create free textbooks for courses on optimization and operations research that are
- Modern (up to date with current techniques and approaches)
- Flexible (easy to adapt to the userâ€™s choice of presentation of material)
- Direct access to code examples (get students up and running faster)
- Foster community collaboration on content authoring and revisions
- Collect figures and images with source code for quality reproducibility
- Host instructive code


This memorandum of understanding (MOU) lays out the contributor expectations, licensing information, and other conditions of participation. All contributors are asked to read through and agree to the terms. Any questions or concerns can be addressed to the project manager: Robert Hildebrand - rhil@vt.edu.

## Role expectations
